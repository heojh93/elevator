### TODO :

- [ ]  Custom Time Library (2x 4x speed possible)
- [ ]  Add simple physical spec to Elevator
- [ ]  Make Elevator Algorithm Better
- [ ]  Save Data (ex. depature/arrive time of each person, avg elapsed time, total moved distance, ...) into each Container  
(consider using DB)
- [ ]  Write benchmark code for evaluating Simulator Algorithm
- [ ]  Write Test Code & Using Jenkins or Travis CI
- [ ]  UI
